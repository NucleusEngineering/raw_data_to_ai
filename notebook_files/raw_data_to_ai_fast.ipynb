This notebook tackles this challenge by building a happiness prediction app. Our core hypothesis is that air quality significantly impacts well-being, and therefore, happiness. We use real-world data on location, air quality, and happiness, supplementing it with synthetic data generated by a Large Language Model.  We then leverage the power of SQL within our data warehouse to train a machine learning model.  Finally, we demonstrate how to use this model to predict happiness scores for specific locations.\n",
